    * The Client MUST send a POST request against a known upload creation URL to request a new upload resource. 
    * The request MUST include one of the following headers:
    * a) Upload-Length to indicate the size of an entire upload in bytes.
    * b) Upload-Defer-Length: 1 if upload size is not known at the time. 
    * Once it is known the Client MUST set the Upload-Length header in the next PATCH request. 
    * Once set the length MUST NOT be changed. As long as the length of the upload is not known, t
    * he Server MUST set Upload-Defer-Length: 1 in all responses to HEAD requests.
    * If the Server supports deferring length, it MUST add creation-defer-length to the Tus-Extension header.
    * The Client MAY supply the Upload-Metadata header to add additional metadata to the upload creation request. 
    * The Server MAY decide to ignore or use this information to further process the request or to reject it. 
    * If an upload contains additional metadata, responses to HEAD requests MUST include the Upload-Metadata 
    * header and its value as specified by the Client during the creation.
    * If the length of the upload exceeds the maximum, which MAY be specified using the Tus-Max-Size header, 
    * the Server MUST respond with the 413 Request Entity Too Large status.
    * The Server MUST acknowledge a successful upload creation with the 201 Created status. 
    * The Server MUST set the Location header to the URL of the created resource. This URL MAY be absolute or relative.
    * The Client MUST perform the actual upload using the core protocol.
    * 
    * If the expiration is known at the creation, the Upload-Expires header MUST be included in the response to the initial POST request. 
    * 
    * The Client MAY include parts of the upload in the initial Creation request using the Creation With Upload extension.
